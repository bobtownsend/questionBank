## Making a question bank
* Clone

1. Make new db at mlabs, questionbank
  * questions collection
2. Connect to new db using Mongoose in your cloned question bank app
3. route '/questions' shows an input template with title question and text box for answer. Currently it just POST and out to console. **MOVE** logic into questions controller. 
4. Create questions schema. Should have at least question, answer, createdAt, updatedAt
5. Now, instead of console.log we want to insert into our database at mlabs that we created!!!!!!! how cool!!!
